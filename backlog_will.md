- Redo existing code using Perplexity ontology
- Implement all nouns in terms of base engine using noun_n()
- Implement "I want ham"
- Dealing with all the duplication of items and combinatorics seems like a waste. Seems like there must be a better way that involves symbolics. For example
  - We want a steak
  - If there are 10 steaks, then want_v_1 will get called 20 times (10 for each person). Whereas if "steak" was symbolic it would only get called twice
