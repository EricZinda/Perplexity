- ESL Architecture
  - Command/Response
    - Scenario: I'd like 2 steaks (at the front door) -> works and it shouldn't
      - Individual solutions succeed with RespondOperations instead of failures
      - Final response is handled by the group predications
        - If it is a single thing, its operation is responded
        - If it is multiple, its operation is overriden by whatever user_wants_multiple returns
- Redo existing code using Perplexity ontology
- Implement all nouns in terms of base engine using noun_n()
- Implement "I want ham"
- Dealing with all the duplication of items and combinatorics seems like a waste. Seems like there must be a better way that involves symbolics. For example
  - We want a steak
  - If there are 10 steaks, then want_v_1 will get called 20 times (10 for each person). Whereas if "steak" was symbolic it would only get called twice
