Remaining work to be shown in the tutorial:

- 
- We don't know whether a string is a file or a folder or something else until we know what you want to do with it
- File system should only delete folders if they really are folders and vice versa

- Support for prepositions
  - show declaring verbs that understand prepositions
- Theory: We don't need to choose different variations of the index of the phrase based on "comm", "ques", etc
  - Except: if we want to use abductive logic to make "The door is open" not evaluated as a question, but as a desire to make that true and then make it true in the system
