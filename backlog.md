- (fixed) Make solution groups do a better job at lazy evaluation
- () Once a solution is found, keeping growing that one
  - Problem is that solution group handlers might throw it away so we need to be able to find others
- Add performance testing to test runs
- Decide how much of a win combinatorics is giving us

- Example25_reset: the 2 files in a folder are 20 mb -> the 2 file in a folder are not in a folder
  - Happens if the_selector_q is commented out and "_the_q" is moved to the_all_q and the_in_scope_q 
    - AND the_all_q is first in the file before the_in_scope_q
  - Expected: I'm not sure which the 2 file in a folder you mean
  - /runparse 0,1
  - the_in_scope_q gets th
    - a_q(x12,_folder_n_of(x12,i17),_the_q(x3,[_file_n_of(x3,i10), _in_p_loc(e11,x3,x12), card(2,e9,x3)],_large_a_1(e2,x3)))
      - if the folder is "/"
      - the_q() gets passed a state that has a combinatoric x12 and so the RSTR yields the same file from multiple folders
      - the_q() is expecting that resolving its RSTR is only going to give back answers for the state that has been built up so far
        - because that is what allows the "the" RSTR to work and to track the unique sets of RSTR values that happen
        - The problem is the combination of combinatorics and scope
        - Options:
          - Stop doing combinatorics
          - Have a lineage to track when RSTR changes
          - Have "the" or "not" force the tree to not do combinatorics
            - Allow predications to mark themselves as requiring linear execution
          - Have a helper that "inverts" the execution and gives an indicator when the scope changes by looking at the values for any combinatorics
            - It is only going to be used by scopal predications if they somehow track scope, which doesn't seem like many besides "the"
            - resolving Scopal args:
              - Can generate multiple solution sets based on scope and at least "the" needs to know when they switch
              - For some reason neg() needs to resolve through phase 2, seems like this shouldn't be the case
              - scopal args for copy() only seem to need phase 1
          - Figure out another way to do THE
            - Can it be done by phase 2 just collecting data?
            - We want the set of RSTRs for the variables that have been set that outscope the quantifier
            - Could this be the same as resolving a scopal arg? where we get some kind of generator of generators 
              - so we know when the outscope values have changed
          - Deal with it like neg() does: run through every combination of scopal variables


- Clean up conceptual versions of have_v and order_v as per nonlogicalquerydesign.md

Code cleanup:
- redo all the noun() type predications to properly return notathing and look like match_all_n_concepts
- Rename lineage something like disjunction
- Alternative Implementation for have_v_1_present and _order_v_1_past
  - There should be one function for have_present() that are straight fact checking routines, that allows the system to just run the query
    - Anything that needs special handling should go to another routine and be treated as a disjunction (i.e. alternative interpretation)
      - I.e. things like implied requests
- Do we still need frames with the new concept handling?
- 

Lower Pri:                
- We have 0 menus -> No. you does not have something 
- referring expressions are different than types. A referring expression can generate types
  - Need to rename these to "referring expressions"
  - Need to rethink what it means for a solution group to have a referring expression in it
    - Does this mean that the solution group handler is looking for the referring expression to return *types*? and we have to check if those *types* meet the criteria?
    - This is a pretty different way of thinking about "concepts" as they were referred to before and may cause lots of code to get rethought
    - BUT: This seems like a clearer way to think about what is going on:
      - The solver generates solution groups with referring expressions
      - Those get resolved into types and instances which get processed
      - etc.

- Doesn't seem like we should have to model the computer as "having the concept of menu?"
- "who has which dish" doesn't work
- I don't have *the* soup works because:
  - there is more than one soup so negation fails, and thus this works
- I don't have soup / I have soup both work when you have ordered soup
  - because:
    - for "I don't have soup" the first MRS is the proper interpretation meaning "not(I have soup)"
      - but it fails since you *do* have soup, so we keep going
    - the second interpretation of "I don't have soup" means "check each soup and see if you have it" and there are some that you don't have
      - so it succeeds and we return this one
  - Same thing will happen with "I don't have a soup"
  - Posted a question on the forum for this

- "What is not soup" --> crashes
  - Can't handle unbound variable in not()
- How many steaks did I order --> doesn't work
- How much is the soup and salad doesn't mark you as knowing the price
- Getting a menu should pass the menu concept all the way through so it can be evaluated
- Get rid of extra arg in relationships 
- Make "check conceptual constraints" properly use eval too

- Make eval() and concepts work more systematically
  - Option 4: Build the concept from the tree directly
    - Find the quantifier for the noun variable
    - Pull off the RSTR?
    - It could literally be implemented by the quantifier converting the RSTR to a concept instead of evaluating it...
    - This seems like the best way to go

  
- lift_style_predication_2
  - should assert if the predication doesn't allow for > 1 in the set
- I want to sit down?
- could I sit down?
- "I will see menus" --> works, but shouldn't
- implement future tense get
  - Will I get a menu?
- Make "I take a steak" or "I get a steak" say "Did you mean X"
- "Do I/my son have a menu?" doesn't work
- "What did I order?" --> Make work for debugging
- implement past tense get: "Did I get a steak?"
- Can we automatically call count_of_instances_and_concepts() for conceptual stuff? So that we don't have to call it in the group?
- Make "how much are your dishes" work
- Verbs should declare what tenses they deal with, if none, they should default to present only
- Figure out how to make "I want 2 steaks and 1 salad" work
  - it only sends "2 steaks" to want so that is all that gets checked
- Get the bill working
- Make "What is not on the menu?" work properly
- Fix ontology.  Right now there are instances on the menu, for example
- Handle concepts with extra information "bill for the food" failing if we don't know it
- I'd like 2 steaks at the front door -> doesn't work
- Not issues: For Example23
  - large files are not in this folder -> Yes, that is true.
    - Interpreted as not(large files in this folder)
- Not able to update tests for /runparse 0,1 to the actual response that happened
- Need to be able to run code on the solution group
  - not() is going to require special processing
- Bug: It looks like collective only checks for one value???
    - whole_group_unique_individuals.update(binding_value) never adds a set of individuals to the set
- Build a backend to use for ESL Scenarios
- make fallback generation more robust
  - at least getting form of words right
- Test plurals:
  - each:
    - the folders have 1 file each
- 
- Dealing with all the duplication of items and combinatorics seems like a waste. Seems like there must be a better way that involves symbolics. For example
  - We want a steak
  - If there are 10 steaks, then want_v_1 will get called 20 times (10 for each person). Whereas if "steak" was symbolic it would only get called twice


- NEED TO UPDATE DOCS FOR VERBS TO MAKE ALL THIS CLEAR:
  - "I want ham" is a proposition that we want to interpret as a command
  - For a verb: Succeeding means it "worked" and should add an operation to change the state
    - it is not modelled as world state as in "I want a burger = True"
    - Really think about a phrase as setting up all the various variables so that the verb can be called
      - Really it just means: this is the proper interpretation, but it might be an error, in which case it can do a RespondOperation
    - delegate to "give me" *as one alternative* if it works, great!
      - If: it is a proposition and IF pron(I) and IF arguments are bound: There is something concrete they want, next determine how to deal with it
          - in the doorway: "I want a table" -> give me a table, "I want a place to sit", "I want to eat " (different want_v), I want a burger" -> "Do you want take-out?"

- Switch the code to use the term "scope-resolved MRS" instead of "well-formed tree" or "scope-resolved tree"
- 3 files are in a folder together -> There is more than a folder together
  - "together_p" is applied to "a folder" and returns an error that there is more than 1 folder "together"
    - together requires sets of more than one be generated, and "a_q" means exactly one
    - Probably should be a special case error if there is a min=1, max=1 constraint on a variable that only generates > 1?
- Really slow: (if at least one isn't) "file1.txt", "file2.txt" and "file3.txt" are in this folder
- 1 file is in a folder together
  - udef(card(1)) is the determiner for this
- How to MRS generate strings that represent the variable at the end of the whole sentence?
  - Theory: Put a quantifier in front of the whole tree?
  - sstring can use MRS generation even in non-default meaning_at_index cases if nothing will contribute english to it
- Will usability: error_priority_function should have a perplexity default that is not "no prioritization". Should at least deprioritize "I don't know word x"
- CARG arguments for things like "polite": "please, could I have a table" in the MRS the argument is first, but in the tree it is last
  - same thing for card(e,x,c) becoming card(c,e,x)
  
- How to deal with "I want a strawberry" when we know about strawberries but there aren't any
  - Do we need different messages based on the state of the world? For example, in the doorway: ""
  - create an object called "CanonicalInstance()" if we are talking about a think "in principle" like "I'd like to order a strawberry"?
  - How to think about it:
    - In a given context, whether something exists or not might elicit a different response, thus a different error
    - We could let verbs handle whether an item is a "canonicalinstance()" or not

- How to answer "what is on the menu?" or "what items are on the menu?" with "we have a lovely selection of ..." 
  - Conceptually this means: read the menu
  - Unbound "what" can trigger an action that adds operations to the results
    - Need a way to insert the beginning "We have a lovely section of " and then the list: x, y, z all from the on_p predication
      - And each one will be a different solution. The user could have said "what are 2 things on the menu?" -> which probably shouldn't have "we have a lovely selection of..." in it
        - But: the on_p predication can't tell
        - Maybe there is a RespondCommand if the whole set is used, and another for a subset?
        - Or there is some kind of global event that gets called to decide the pre and postamble?
          - Could it be a "solution group" event?
  - The question "is fish on the menu" should be answered with "yes"
  - Look at what we did in adventure.pl with querySetAnswer()
    - Possibly we need different predications for attributive vs. predicative? Or index?
- Add chat_gpt code so we can play with using it for nouns

- Docs: Need to write a section on predication design
  - Objects should be implemented purely and independently so that the magic of language and logic "just work"
  
Plurals work 
- Example 33: "delete only 2 files in the folder" -> There are more than 2 file in the folder
  - delete only two files in the folder -> (are you sure, this will be random?)
- delete the only two files in the folder -> should fail
- Example 33: "a file is a few megabytes" doesn't work
  - Also very slow
- Need to give a good error when Example 37: "which files are in a folder" or "(which) files are large" or "files are large" fails because there is only one file.
    - Also: Example 33: which files are in folders?
    - Bad error message, should be "less than 2 files are large"
- which 2 files are in a folder? (in a folder with more than 2): There is more than 2 2 file in a folder
  - Need a better error message
- Bug: Example 28: "a few files are 20 MB" says "there are more"
  - 3 files are counted as "a few" when 1 is 20 mb and the other 2 add up to 20 mb
  - Is this right?
- TODO: For propositions, we need to respond with "there are more" if it is "at least" or "exactly" once we get above the level that a normal person would say "at least" for
- Theory: Forward readings of trees are better
- Example 25: "which files are in a folder" -> when there are 2 files in one folder, and then a single in two other folders -> only returns the two files in one folder
  - Theory: Forward readings of trees are better
  - The tree that has folder first can't return the singles because we say "files" and there is only 1
    - So, the two files in the same folder are the only answer returned
    - when files is first, it can get them all

- Test that this approach works by going through examples. Scenarios to try:
  - not
    - Anything that converts to between(x, y) should work
      - not more than x = between(1, x), not less than x between(x, inf)
      - some = between(2, inf)?
    - no files are in a folder: no_q() succeeds with no values
      - _a_q(x9,_folder_n_of(x9,i14),_no_q(x3,_file_n_of(x3,i8),_in_p_loc(e2,x3,x9)))

  - Slow Scenarios
    - Options:
      - Get rid of sets that can't possibly be right so we don't keep checking them
        - which 3 files are in a folder: have to keep around all the old ones in case there are duplicates. Faster way to check them?
      - Use a tree structure to quickly add a solution to the right groups
        - Build a data structure like the one they use in 3d games to divide the world?
    - Slow Scenarios:
      - Example33: which 2 files in the folder are large?
        - Very slow
        - There are two folders but we have to exhaust all possibilities for 2 files first
      - Bug: Which 2 files in the folder are large is still too slow
      - Example 33: "which 3 files are in 2 folders"
        - still VERY slow
        - Still need to generate all combinations of 3 x 2 to find out that none are in 2 folders
        - all combinations of 3 of 100 is 4950, for 1000 it is 499500, 3 of 200 is 1313400
      - "which 2 files in the folder are large?"
        - very slow
        - because the second folder doesn't show up until the very end and we are checking for "the folder"
      - Example 33: "a file is a few megabytes" is very slow

- copy x to y
  - needs copy with a scopal arg
    - We need to support turning a tree into something abstract that can be manipulated and understood
      - We could simply use the tree directly but then we'd have to special case all of the prepositions
      - Instead, we will create a special event that the scopal args get attached to
      - Then ask the tree to "interpret itself" in an abstract way that we have a chance of understanding
        - Some terms are actual things in the world and others are the way we want it to be
      - How?
        - We could run the predications using abductive logic?
        - We could "make a plan" to make X true
        - We could special case prepositions and just handle them
        - We could assume the scopal argument contains a particular thing (that depends on the predication it is in) and ask for that thing
          - i.e. copy assumes a locative preposition and looks for that
          - Can we find out what kinds of things "copy" can take as its scopal argument?
        - Theory: the verb with the scopal argument has an arg that is resolved in the scopal argument
          - Not true for make me be quieter, the argument comes from somewhere else
        - Theory:
          - The scopal argument determines some state change for the topic being verbed. The verb needs to collect this state change and then make it happen in the manner of verbing:
              - put the vase on the table: _put_v_1(e2,x3,x8,_on_p_loc(e15,x8,x16))
                - "put" means "move" so: put_v first makes a copy of x8, and then lets scopal "do what it does" to it
              - paint the tree green: _paint_v_1(e2,x3,x8,_green_a_2(e16,x8))
                - "paint" means "change it to" so it lets its arguments just do that
              - make me be quieter: _make_v_cause(e2,x3,(more_comp(e16,e15,u17), _quiet_a_1(e15,x10)))
                - Make is a special case
              - It would be *ideal* if this was just the same as abduction.  It isn't quite, since the verb (paint, copy) changes what happens:
                - paint the flower in the corner
                - copy the file in the folder
                - both use a scopal for _in_p_loc(e15,x8,x16) but what "in" does very different
                - effectively, "paint x in the corner" and "paint x blue" are very different operations meaning different paints
                  - so maybe the best approach is to build a different version of paint for each class of thing it can handle and treat it like a new argument
                  - reflect should copy data about itself into its event in a form that can be easily parsed
                  - How to find the right target in the scopal arg?
                    - Find all predications that use it as their ARG1?
                  - And then let "quoting" create a representation that puts them into "classes"
                    - "quoting" has to be special case code per predication because conversion into a canoncal form is per predication and not directly determinable from arguments. For example "copy the file above folderx" has above(folderx) but the copying should happen in the folder above it
  - also copy x in y (the same scenario)

  - Support for prepositions
    - show declaring verbs that understand prepositions
  - Theory: We don't need to choose different variations of the index of the phrase based on "comm", "ques", etc
    - Except: if we want to use abductive logic to make "The door is open" not evaluated as a question, but as a desire to make that true and then make it true in the system
