Remaining work to be shown in the tutorial:
  
- the final fw_seq should convert the object to all the objects it could be
- Support for prepositions
  - show declaring verbs that understand prepositions
- Theory: We don't need to choose different variations of the index of the phrase based on "comm", "ques", etc
  - Except: if we want to use abductive logic to make "The door is open" not evaluated as a question
