Remaining work to be shown in the tutorial:

- "/" doesn't work
- "/foo" in "/bar" doesn't either
- "\foo" does
- copy x to y
  - needs copy with a scopal arg
  - also copy x in y (the same scenario)

- Support for prepositions
  - show declaring verbs that understand prepositions
- Theory: We don't need to choose different variations of the index of the phrase based on "comm", "ques", etc
  - Except: if we want to use abductive logic to make "The door is open" not evaluated as a question, but as a desire to make that true and then make it true in the system
