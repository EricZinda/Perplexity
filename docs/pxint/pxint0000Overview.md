## Perplexity Internals
This section walks through the details of implementing the concepts described in the [MRS Solver Conceptual](../devcon/devcon0000Overview) section in a Python application.  It is assumed that the concepts from that section are understood (and links are always provided).

If you just want to *use* the Perplexity system to build a natural language interface to a program, you can also just jump right to the ["Using Perplexity"](../pxHowTo/pxHowTo010Overview) section. If you want to understand how it all works, you're in the right place.
