## Summary and What Wasn't Covered
In the course of this internals section, we have implemented everything necessary to build a simple natural language system that can be used to allow human language phrases to be the interface for many types of applications.  The basic approach is exactly how Perplexity is implemented, but because Perplexity is a production system, there are many more corner cases, exceptions and performance improvements in its code. The idea of this whole section is to allow you to build your own Perplexity-type system, perhaps with another language, perhaps with a different approach after learning how Perplexity itself is architected.

However, one key part of how to implement a Perplexity-like system has not been described: building the mechanism to properly implement *solution groups* as described in [Collective and Distributive Readings](../devcon/devcon0030MRSSolverSolutionGroups). These are required for many types of sentences including any that have multiple plurals, such as "two girls ate two ice cream cones". A conceptual description of how to implement this is covered in the appendices of the conceptual material: [Implementing the Solution Group Algorithm](../devcon/devcon0040MRSSolverSolutionGroupsAlgorithm) and [Optimizing the Solution Group Algorithm](../devcon/devcon0050MRSSolverSolutionCombinations).
