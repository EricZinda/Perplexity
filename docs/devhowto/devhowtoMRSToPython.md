## Converting MRS Text to Python Function Calls
So far, we have been calling our predications directly as functions. To be able to solve an MRS we're going to need a way to convert from the MRS text representation to actual Python function calls. This section describes how.

We'll use a simple Python representation that allows easy conversion from a raw MRS document: each predication will be a Python `list` with the predication name as the first element and the arguments as the rest. Like this for the `_folder_n_of(x1)` and `compound(e1, x1, x2)` predications:
~~~
["_folder_n_of", "x1"]
["compound", "e1", "x1", "x2"]
~~~

To convert this representation into a Python function (like the one we wrote [earlier](devhowtoImplementPredication)) and call it, we need a mapping from the string name (e.g. `"_folder_n_of"`) to the function and module where the function lives. We'll do this using a Python feature called "decorators". It isn't important to understand *how* it works (but if you want to: [read this section](devhowtoPythonDecorators)). For our purposes, just understand that by writing two small Python classes we can now write code like this:
~~~
# You can create global variables in Python
# by just setting their values outside the scope
# of any function, like this:
vocabulary = Vocabulary()

@Predication(vocabulary, name="_folder_n_of")
def folder_n_of(state, x_target):
    # ... implementation of folder_n_of goes here ...
~~~

The `@Predication(...)` "decoration" above the function runs code that sticks the Python function (i.e. `def folder_n_of(...)`) and the predication name (i.e. `_folder_n_of`) into the global instance of the `Vocabulary` class it is given. 

Note that the function name can be arbitrarily different than the predication name. In this case, we've removed the leading "_", but we could have done something more radical, like this:

~~~
vocabulary = Vocabulary()

@Predication(vocabulary, name="_folder_n_of")
def my_folder_predication(state, x_target):
    # ... implementation of folder_n_of goes here ...
~~~

Either way, the global `vocabulary` instance will record the mapping between all of the functions decorated with `@Predication(vocabulary, name=...)` and the predication they are implementing. With that, we can now build a `CallPredication()` function that uses `vocabulary` to map the string name of the predicate, plus the list of arguments, to an actual Python function and execute the contract on it:

~~~
# The format we're using is:
# ["folder_n_of", "x1"]
#   The first item is the predication name
#   The rest of the items are the arguments
def CallPredication(vocabulary, state, predication):
    # The [0] syntax returns the first item in a list
    predication_name = predication[0]

    # The [1:] syntax returns a new list that starts from
    # the first item and goes until the end of the list
    predication_args = predication[1:]

    # Look up the actual Python module and
    # function name given a string like "folder_n_of".
    # "vocabulary.Predication" returns a two-item list,
    # where item[0] is the module and item[1] is the function
    module_function = vocabulary.Predication(predication_name)

    # sys.modules[] is a built-in Python list that allows you
    # to access actual Python Modules given a string name
    module = sys.modules[module_function[0]]

    # Functions are modeled as properties of modules in Python
    # and getattr() allows you to retrieve a property.
    # So: this is how we get the "function pointer" to the
    # predication function we wrote in Python
    function = getattr(module, module_function[1])

    # [list] + [list] will return a new, combined list
    # in Python. This is how we add the state object
    # onto the front of the argument list
    function_args = [state] + predication_args

    # You call a function "pointer" and pass it arguments
    # that are a list by using "function(*function_args)"
    # So: this is actually calling our function (which
    # returns an iterator and thus we can iterate over it)
    for next_state in function(*function_args):
        yield next_state

def Example2():
    state = State([Folder(name="Desktop"),
                   Folder(name="Documents"),
                   File(name="file1.txt"),
                   File(name="file2.txt")])

    for item in CallPredication(vocabulary,
                                state,
                                ["_folder_n_of", "x1"]):
        print(item.variables)

# Calling Example2() outputs:
{'x1': Folder(name=Desktop)}
{'x1': Folder(name=Documents)}
~~~

The `Example2()` function shows how we can use all of this to call a predication using our new text-based format. With this in place, we can tackle more complicated groups of predications such as conjunctions in the [next section](devhowtoConjunctions).
