## MRS Solver Concepts
All of the topics in this section are designed to describe the algorithms and concepts needed to build a backtracking solver for an MRS document -- without actually building one. It is meant to provide the background needed for anyone wanting to approach the subject without getting deep into the details of coding one up. 

The next section, ["Perplexity Internals"](../pxint/pxint0000Overview), *does* walk through the details of building one in Python. It assumes the concepts are already understood from reading this section.

The first topic in this section, ["Backtracking"](devcon0010MRSSolver), walks through the general approach we'll be using to solve MRS documents. Topics after that build on this base.
