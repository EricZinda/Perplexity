## wh-questions
what do you have? -> kitchen
  - expected If you'd like to hear about our menu items, you'll need to have a seat
  - It used to be that "what do you have?" gave a maximal group and so it triggered the "asking for a menu" response
  - Now it gives a minimal group and "kitchen" happens to be the first thing that gets returned
  - Both the minimal and maximal are technically "correct", but the maximal is more correct since a minimal answer is misleading
    - The "pragmatics" would be that "wh-questions" should always be implied "what are all the" questions
