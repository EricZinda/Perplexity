The undetermined solutions are true in any combination (since each is true individually).  i.e. they are combinatorial solutions.
If a given variable is still combinatorial, it means that solution represents N individual solutions

"Only/Exactly", much like the quantifier "the" does more than just group solutions into groups ("only 2 files are in the folder") it also limits *all* the solutions to that number. So we need to go to the bitter end before we know that that are "only 2" group_rstr is set in the criteria each time a rstr is checked.

Also, as soon as >2 are found, abort the whole thing

At the very end return all sets
