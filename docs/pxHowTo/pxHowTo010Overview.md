## Using Perplexity
Perplexity is a Python library designed to support building natural language software interfaces on DELPH-IN grammars. Interfaces are built by implementing an application vocabulary using Python functions.

This section is designed to teach users how to use the Perplexity system to build a natural language interface to a piece of software. It assumes a general understanding of concepts described in the [MRS Solver Conceptual](../devcon/devcon0000Overview) section, but also links to them liberally as encountered. 

If you are looking for how Perplexity itself is implemented, take a look at the [Perplexity Internals](../pxint/pxint0000Overview) section. 

With that said, let's get started. The first step is to [install Perplexity](pxHowTo012Install.md).
