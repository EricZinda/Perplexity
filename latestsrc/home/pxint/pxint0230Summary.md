{% raw %}## Summary
In the course of this internals section we have implemented everything necessary to build a simple natural language system that can be interfaced with any type of application.  The basic approach is exactly how Perplexity is implemented, but because Perplexity is a production system there are many more corner cases, exceptions and performance improvements that are in the code. The idea of this section was to allow you to build your own Perplexity-type system, perhaps with another language, perhaps with a different approach after learning how Perplexity itself is architected.
