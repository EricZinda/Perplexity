{% raw %}## Using Perplexity
Perplexity is a Python library designed to support building natural language software interfaces on DELPH-IN grammars. Interfaces are built by implementing an application vocabulary using Python functions.

This section is designed to teach users how to use the Perplexity system to build a natural language interface to a piece of software. It assumes a general understanding of concepts described in the [MRS Solver Conceptual](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/Perplexity/home/devcon/devcon0000Overview) section, but also links to them liberally as encountered. 

If you are looking for how Perplexity itself is implemented, take a look at the [Perplexity Internals](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/Perplexity/home/pxint/pxint0000Overview) section. 

With that said, let's get started. The first step is to [install Perplexity](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/Perplexity/home/pxHowTo/pxHowTo012Install).
