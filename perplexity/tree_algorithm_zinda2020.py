This file has the code that builds scope resolved trees from an MRS.  This process is described here: https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/blog/ResolvingTheMRSTree

Here is a link to a paper on how to efficiently solve MRS structures that
I found after writing all this: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W05-1105.pdf

First some definitions:
- **Hole**: A scopal (i.e. `h` type) argument in an MRS predicate that doesn't refer to an existing predication
- **Floater**: A tree of predications that have had zero or more of their scopal (i.e. `h` type) arguments filled by unique predications.  [This is not at official MRS term, it is one created for this algorithm]

As a reminder, a tree is "well-formed" if:

1. Each predication is assigned to one, and only one, hole. No holes are left unfilled, and no predications are unassigned at the end  
2. None of the assignments of predications to holes violates a `qeq` constraint 
3. Any variable introduced by a quantifier is not used outside of the branches assigned to its `RSTR` or `BODY` arguments  

**Here's the intuition for how the algorithm works**: We are going to walk a search tree.  Every node of the search tree represents a partial assignment of floaters to holes that meets the above 3 constraints. Every arc from a parent node in the search tree to a child node in the search tree represents a unique assignment of a (otherwise unassigned) floater to a hole.  If that assignment violates a constraint, the search tree node is not valid (since obviously keeping this assignment and adding floaters to it can't be valid either) and we stop searching that whole branch of the search tree. This pruning is what makes it faster than the really naive "try every option" approach. Every node in the search tree that has no holes left to assign is a solution.

**Algorithm Flow**: We start at the `TOP:` hole and record on it any `qeq` constraints that apply to it and any `X` variables that are in scope for it (none at the start). As we traverse an arc in the search tree and assign a new floater to a hole, we propagate any constraints and in-scope variables from the (parent) hole to the holes in the (child) floater.  Then we recurse.

**Start with**:  
Each node in the search tree has the following structures that represent where the search has progressed to:
  - `all_holes_dict`:            Dictionary populated with all the holes in the MRS. Each hole has information about:
                               - the `qeq` constraints that currently apply to it
                               - the `X` variables that are currently in scope for it
                               - the floater it is from 
  - `node_assignment_list`:      Assignments of floaters to holes that the search tree node represents. Empty for the initial node. 
  - `node_remaining_holes_list`: Holes left to fill in this search tree node. Only contains the `TOP:` hole for the initial node.
  - `node_remaining_floaters_list`: Floaters still unassigned at this node in the search tree. Contains all floaters for the initial node. Each floater contains information about:
                               - a list of holes it contains
                               - a list of unresolved `x` variables it contains 
                               - a list of any `Lo` parts of a `qeq` constraint it contains (if it doesn't also have the `Hi` part in the floater) 

**Algorithm**:  
Starting at the initial node:
 - Get `current_hole` by removing the first hole from `node_remaining_holes_list` 
 - Get `current_floater` by removing each floater from `node_remaining_floaters_list` and: 
     - If `current_floater` does not violate the constraints in `current_hole`: 
         - Add `current_hole = current_floater` to `nodeAssignmentList`
         - Propagate the constraints and variables from the new parent to all holes in `current_floater` 
         - Add holes from `current_floater` to the end of `node_remaining_holes_list` 
         - Check number of holes left:
            - if == 0, return `node_assignment_list` as a solution
            - otherwise, continue the search by "creating a new search tree node" via recursing to the top of the algorithm

**Returns**:
`node_assignment_list` which is simply a dictionary where the keys are holes and the value is the floater that was assigned to it

Once this has run its course you will have all the valid well-formed trees for the MRS. Here is the Python code for the main routine, it contains logging that is useful for debugging as well:
