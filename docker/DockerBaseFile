# Before doing any of this you'll need to install Docker
# To publish it, you'll need to get a DockerHub account
#
# To build the base image:
# From the repository root, run:
#   docker build --no-cache -t p8ybase -f ./docker/DockerBaseFile ./
#
# To push your image to docker hub so others can access it:
# 1. Tag it with <your docker username>/<what you want to call it>, for example: inductorsoftware/p8ybase
#   docker tag p8ybase:latest inductorsoftware/p8ybase
#
# 2. Push it to docker hub:
#   docker push inductorsoftware/p8ybase
#
# 3. Others can then access it by going to: https://hub.docker.com/r/inductorsoftware/p8ybase
#       i.e. the URL is https://hub.docker.com/r/<your docker hub user name>/<what you called it>
#
# 4. Others can then run your project using the instructions above for running an image
