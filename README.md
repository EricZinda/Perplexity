# Perplexity
This is the fully Python based implementation of the [Perplexity engine](https://perplexitygame.com/).

It has a [tutorial](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/Perplexity/) that explains how it is built and how it leverages [DELPH-IN](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/) technologies, in great detail.
